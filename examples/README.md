# enDjinn examples

The following examples are provided:

## hello_enDjinn
The [hello_enDjinn](./hello_enDjinn/) example is a bare bones 
 'get a rotating sprite on screen in fewer than 100 lines' of C. 
It implicitly also shows of the power of the underlying enDjinn make system, that is activated simply 
by sym-linking the [enDjinn/Makefile.primary](../Makefile.primary) file to a **Makefile** in your project directory.


## enDjinn_controls
The [enDjinn_controls](./enDjinn_controls/) example demonstrates the controller input reading system while adding a bit of interactivity.

## enDjinn_modes
The [enDjinn_modes](./enDjinn_modes/) example demonstrates the built in state handling in the enj_mod_% subsystem.
