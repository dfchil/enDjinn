# enDjinn examples

The following examples are provided:

## enj_hello
The [enj_hello](./enj_hello/) example is a bare bones 
 'get a rotating sprite on screen in fewer than 100 lines' of C. 
It implicitly also shows of the power of the underlying enDjinn make system, that is activated simply 
by sym-linking the [enDjinn/Makefile.prime](../Makefile.prime) file to a **Makefile** in your project directory.


## enj_controls
The [enj_controls](./enj_controls/) example demonstrates the controller input reading system while adding a bit of interactivity.

## enj_modes
The [enj_modes](./enj_modes/) example demonstrates the built in state handling in the enj_mod_% subsystem.
